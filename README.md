# Ruby Client for Sentry

- `sentry-raven` is the current (old) client. It will stay at the 3.1.x series without major enhancements in the future (but we still welcome PRs!).
- `sentry-ruby` will be the new client and is under ğŸš§ active development ğŸš§. This issue contains the [plan](https://github.com/getsentry/raven-ruby/issues/1029) for it.
